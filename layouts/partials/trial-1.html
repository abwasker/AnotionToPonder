<h2>John 3:5-8</h2>
<p> Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. 
    Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 
    You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’ 
    The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. 
    So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”
