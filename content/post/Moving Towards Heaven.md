# Moving Towards Heaven

## A reflection-very rough one

Date: March 13, 2020

My career and God’s bigger picture for my life have to overlap. I cannot seem to isolate these two for my life. And I don't know if I can see them ever being or standing separate. This, then, begs the question, well, what is the bigger picture? In fact, what is the ideal that God has for me/us?

I was introduced to the philosophical perspective of freedom through a modern and contemporary philosophy class as an undergraduate. I was impressed by Hegel and his perspective to provide an alternative to that of Kant's, which was becoming quite popular. 

Freedom is the highest ideal according to Hegel and for him the end result of that, resembles all the desires of an individual reflected in the State and that of the State in the individual. What this means is that somehow the individual with all their freedom and sovereignty can claim that their desires are reflected in a collective body-the State. The State somewhat resembles a governing body. I like to think of it as a collective group to simplify things. Now the collective group or the State can claim that its desires are reflected in each individual. 

When I came across this, I knew I'd seen this image somewhere before. I saw the similarity of the State-individual paradigm in the image of the Bride, the church- the body of Christ. The body being a collective is where the individual is recognized for her individual worth. Her sovereign choice and desires are preserved in their identity of who she is and so also reflected in the larger body.

Now what was missing was an entity that gave the desires of the State and individual purpose or deeper still– meaning. Desires come from within the individual but to bring meaning to those desires requires its sustenance and validation by an external entity. By bringing meaning, I mean it provides value to even consider it as a possibility.

God beautifully wraps around the collective and individual. I see this ideal reflected in the Book of Revelation with the city without walls. Again, this highlights freedom but yet has God the benevolent leader at the center allowing and bringing meaning and purpose to the individual and the State or the Body. Their desires fully being affirmed. Maybe this is heaven? Now if this is the ideal, then it is indeed quite abstract. How, then, do I answer my initial question in light of this ideal? What is the overlap between my career and God's bigger picture that I cannot isolate?

To bring it out of abstraction and into practical utility, let’s say heaven is an ideal and so, we can see this 'mutual desires enveloped by God' being fulfilled. Then what I must see, is the gospel moving believers towards heaven; towards the kingdom of God being established in full. This means a transformation of the individual and the society.

Let’s consider the spread of Christianity in the African continent. Once I was having a conversation with a friend on the validity of Christian practice in the church today and the question he posed was- "what does it mean for Christianity to be growing rapidly?" Or what does it mean for the gospel to grow rapidly? We often say that it is growing rapidly in third world countries like Tunisia, Congo etc. but what is the outcome of the gospel being present in those countries? We cannot disagree about the huge economic disparity of the countries in Africa in comparison to that of any other continent. My claim is that we should see a shift in economy as you see the gospel growing. It has to affect how people act out their lives to lead towards a more selfless society and function properly. Do we see this happening? 

My sense is that the gospel brings about societal transformation. The gospel leads to heaven–the kingdom of God being established. The good news brings about freedom of the individual and the collective. It moves us toward the ideal of a city without walls where peace is rampant, and justice and righteousness are sustained by God. It is not so much of a wishful thought but an actuality that can be manifested.

I am not proposing a prosperity gospel what I'm suggesting is a shift in society towards holistic well-being, which is not a new suggestion. A move towards the eradication of injustices like poverty, discrimination, racism, casteism, mass incarceration and other forms of oppression. While I am not suggesting a socialist or communist movement, I am suggesting that, although the outcome will not be the same, it might look similar but will infact lead to a more holistic place. At least some aspects of it.
