Fire cannot be ignored; caution and curiosity usher fascination. Gazing into its flames, be it that of a candle or a bonfire, kindles some deep consideration. Threat or hope? Stare at it long enough and perhaps, could it be both? The onlooker is presented with a choice–nay, even better–a grave and solemn responsibility for the power they behold. 


No wonder this has long intrigued posterity! For it is a symbol, not just of struggle, but of being broken and refined; a powerful narrative weaved out of carnal and spiritual experience. It risks the metaphor becoming metaphysical by its piercing nature. 


While all are put in the fire, only a remanent endure. Tested like silver and refined like gold; their work is shown for what it is worth because the Day will bring it to light. It will all be revealed with fire. Faces in the fire shall be seen clearly. They won’t perish like refined silver but reflect what they see– glory!


It is on that day that these faces in the fire shall be heard calling an ancient name saying, ‘YHWH is our God’ and he will proclaim, ‘They are my people’.
