# Haunting Hurts and Fading Twilight
## April 22, 2020. (Edits Oct 11, 2020)
<p class="verse">
Haunting hurt still within<br />
The past, a bridge I crossed<br />
Burned now the memory will not<br />
be erased. Devouring rage.<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Distance between us is the hope<br />
To bring from the future<br />
Consequences into the present<br />
which then becomes the past.<br />
Hurt haunts the heart.<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
I thought I knew you, friends<br />
Chose something precious<br />
But not our friendship<br />
wrought to become what it may<br />
Left out for infesting fleas<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Left with intention to put no intention.<br />
This, said I, is my lot.<br />
Will love find me?<br />
Will serenity be found?<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Would revenge be worth it<br />
if it was what I sought<br />
Sublimely portent<br />
To engage, not evade<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
You are me when I failed.<br />
You are me when I let let go<br />
of simple respect and human value.<br />
Reduced from what was once whole.<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Trepidation.<br />
Embraced with love and care<br />
Purpose<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Let me find it in my heart to let you go.<br />
To let you be free of my captive hurt.<br />
When I will come to look you in the face<br />
and see nothing but love.<br />
</p>

<p class="verse">
Deep disheveled red tunics couldn't be more brighter in the twilight of my heart.<br />
</p>
