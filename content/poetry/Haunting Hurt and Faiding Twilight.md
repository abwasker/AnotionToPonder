# Haunting Hurts and Fading Twilight
## April 22, 2020. (Edits Oct 11, 2020)

Haunting hurt still within   
The past, a bridge I crossed   
Burned now the memory will not   
be erased. Devouring rage.   

Distance between us is the hope   
To bring from the future   
Consequences into the present   
which then becomes the past.   
Hurt haunts the heart.   

  

I thought I knew you, friends   
Chose something precious   
But not our friendship   
wrought to become what it may   
Left out for infesting fleas   

  

Left with intention to put no intention.   
This, said I, is my lot.   
Will love find me?   
Will serenity be found?   

Would revenge be worth it   
if it was what I sought   
Sublimely portent   
To engage, not evade   

  

You are me when I failed.   
You are me when I let let go   
of simple respect and human value.   
Reduced from what was once whole.
